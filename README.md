# Issue Bot

## About

Work on a distributed team? Try using Issue Bot as a Scrum [standup](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stand-up_meeting) process automation bot to keep track of what you're all working on. ü§ñ

Have repeated tasks you're setting reminders for elsewhere? Issue Bot's got your back there, too. üëè

Or just need an issue created on a certain condition? Issue Bot is there when your CI build breaks. üíî

Issue Bot is a flexible GitHub Action that will open a new issue based on `input` values issue template of your choice. You can make it close the most recent one of its type, you can pin it, and since it's open source, [pull requests](https://github.com/imjohnbo/issue-bot/compare) are welcome!

## v3 Migration
‚ö†Ô∏è If you're a `v2` user, please note that these breaking changes were introduced in `v3`: ‚ö†Ô∏è
- `template` functionality has been moved to a separate action: https://github.com/imjohnbo/extract-issue-template-fields.
- `labels` now checks if **all** labels match. Before, it checked if **any** labels matched.

and these features were added üéâ:
- `project` and `column` for adding an issue to a [repository project board](https://docs.github.com/en/github/managing-your-work-on-github/about-project-boards).
- `milestone` for adding an issue to a [milestone](https://docs.github.com/en/github/managing-your-work-on-github/tracking-the-progress-of-your-work-with-milestones).

As always, your feedback and [contributions](#contributing) are welcome.
