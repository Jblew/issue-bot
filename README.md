# Issue Bot

## About

Work on a distributed team? Try using Issue Bot as a Scrum [standup](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stand-up_meeting) process automation bot to keep track of what you're all working on. ü§ñ

Have repeated tasks you're setting reminders for elsewhere? Issue Bot's got your back there, too. üëè

Or just need an issue created on a certain condition? Issue Bot is there when your CI build breaks. üíî

Issue Bot is a flexible GitHub Action that will open a new issue based on `input` values issue template of your choice. You can make it close the most recent one of its type, you can pin it, and since it's open source, [pull requests](https://github.com/imjohnbo/issue-bot/compare) are welcome!

## Usage

As a daily standup bot:

```yml
name: Daily Standup
on:
  schedule:
  - cron: 0 12 * * *  # Every day at noon ‚Äì https://crontab.guru

jobs:
  daily_standup:
    name: Daily Standup
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:

    # Repo code checkout required if `template` is used
    - name: Checkout
      uses: actions/checkout@v2

    - name: issue-bot
      uses: imjohnbo/issue-bot@v2
      with:
        assignees: "comma, delimited, list, of, handles" # GitHub handles without the @
        labels: "standup"
        pinned: true
        close-previous: true
        template: ".github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/standup.md" # assignees, labels will be overridden if present in YAML header
      env:
        GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
```

To keep track of repeated tasks:

```yml
name: Generate TPS reports
on:
  schedule:
  - cron: 0 0 1 * *  # First of every month ‚Äì https://crontab.guru

jobs:
  tps_reports:
    name: TPS reports
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:

    # Repo code checkout required if `template` is used
    - name: Checkout
      uses: actions/checkout@v2

    - name: issue-bot
      uses: imjohnbo/issue-bot@v2
      with:
        assignees: "me"     # your GitHub handle without the @
        labels: "tps, bug"
        pinned: false
        close-previous: false
        template: "tps.md"
      env:
        GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
```

Or just downstream of a failed CI step üíî:

```yml
name: Continuous Integration
on:
  [push, pull_request]

jobs:
  ci:
    name: CI
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:

    # Repo code checkout required if `template` is used
    - name: Checkout
      uses: actions/checkout@v2

    - name: CI
      run: |
        echo "...these are some CI steps..."

    - name: issue-bot
      if: failure()
      uses: imjohnbo/issue-bot@v2
      with:
        assignees: "handles, of, my, teammates"    # GitHub handles without the @
        label: "ci"
        pinned: false
        close-previous: false
        template: "ci-failure.md"
      env:
