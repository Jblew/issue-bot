## About

Work on a distributed team? Try using Issue Bot as a Scrum [standup](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stand-up_meeting) process automation bot to keep track of what you're all working on. ü§ñ

Have repeated tasks you're setting reminders for elsewhere? Issue Bot's got your back there, too. üëè

Or just need an issue created on a certain condition? Issue Bot is there when your CI build breaks. üíî

Issue Bot is a flexible GitHub action that takes care of a few issue related tasks:
- Opens new issue with `title`, `body`, `labels`, and `assignees`
- Uses [Mustache templating syntax](https://github.com/janl/mustache.js) in `body`, along with a couple of handy template variables: `assignees` and `previousIssueNumber`
- Closes most recent previous issue with all `labels` if `close-previous` is true
- Adds new issue to `project` (user, organization, or repository project based on value of `project-type`), `column`, and `milestone`
- Pins new issue and unpins previous issue if `pinned` is true
- Makes issue comments linking new and previous issues if `linked-comments` is true
- Assigns new issue only to the _next_ assignee in the list if `rotate-assignees` is true. Useful for duty rotation like first responder.
- Pairs well with [imjohnbo/extract-issue-template-fields](https://github.com/imjohnbo/extract-issue-template-fields) if you'd prefer to open issues based on [issue templates](https://docs.github.com/en/github/building-a-strong-community/about-issue-and-pull-request-templates#issue-templates)

## v3 Migration
‚ö†Ô∏è If you're a `v2` user, please note that these breaking changes were introduced in `v3`: ‚ö†Ô∏è
- `template` functionality has been moved to a separate action: https://github.com/imjohnbo/extract-issue-template-fields.
- `labels` now checks if **all** labels match. Before, it checked if **any** labels matched.

and these features were added üéâ:
- `project` and `column` for adding an issue to a [repository project board](https://docs.github.com/en/github/managing-your-work-on-github/about-project-boards).
- `milestone` for adding an issue to a [milestone](https://docs.github.com/en/github/managing-your-work-on-github/tracking-the-progress-of-your-work-with-milestones).

As always, your feedback and [contributions](#contributing) are welcome.
